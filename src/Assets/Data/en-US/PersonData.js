        description :`My name is Lucas Baldasso, I am 24 years old and currently living in Guarapuava-PR/BR while studying in my 5th period of Software Engineering. I am a fullstack developer with focus on backend. My main stack is C# and .NET Core. Also, I am very flexible with backend programming languages and frameworks. My main field of study is Object Oriented Programming. I've done a reasearch on the OOP field which was presented it on SAPIEN which is a academic week on my University. I am constantly seeking new challenges, particularly those that allow me to acquire new skills and abilities. I am dedicated to personal and professional growth. I also strive to find new and creative ways to improve the environment I am in and the technologies I am working with. My passion for sharing knowledge always compels me to clearly explain my thought process and actions, and I am always open to suggestions. I am a great team player, always giving my best effort in the tasks I am responsible for and actively seeking to understand and collaborate with others to identify areas for improvement. I am also always willing to assist others with questions or challenges they may be facing, resulting in a more seamless workflow and a highly synergistic team dynamic. Additionally, I am an enthusiast of game development, having created my first game during my 3rd period of university and continuing to improve it as I acquire new knowledge both in school and on my own.`,
